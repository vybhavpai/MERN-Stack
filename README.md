# MERN-Stack-

This repo, is a part of [My experiments](https://github.com/vybhavpai/React-Learning) with the React Framework. This repository is aimed to record progress in the Udemy Course - [MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux and Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/). Started the course on May 25, 2021.

1. May 26, 2021: Completed the first two modules which involved introduction, environmental setup, and setup associated with MongoDB and Express.
2. May 29, 2021: Finished the third module, to be honest I could have completed much faster. Third module had everything associated with user registration and validation.
3. June 1, 2021: Halfway through building the routes associated with profiles. Took a small break in between which slowed down the progress.
