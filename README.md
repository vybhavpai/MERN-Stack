# MERN-Stack-

This repo, is a part of [My experiments](https://github.com/vybhavpai/React-Learning) with the React Framework. This repository is aimed to record progress in the Udemy Course - [MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux and Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/). Started the course on May 25, 2021.

1. May 26, 2021: Completed the first two modules which involved introduction, environmental setup, and setup associated with MongoDB and Express.
2. May 29, 2021: Finished the third module, to be honest I could have completed much faster. Third module had everything associated with user registration and validation.
3. June 1, 2021: Halfway through building the routes associated with profiles. Took a small break in between which slowed down the progress.
4. June 4, 2021: Completed the profiles section of the course, was quite nice and involved. Also learnt about how we can use github apis to fetch relevant data.
5. June 7, 2021: Completed all the routes asscoiated with posts, which marked the end of work on backend side of things. Will start with Front end hereafter.
6. June 14, 2021: Completed the setup of React of the project, quite alot of the front end was already written and given in html. He has a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFM9hbapeA0&list=PLillGF-Rfqba3xeEvDzIcUCxwMlGiewfV) on building the front end
7. June 17, 2021: Completed User Authentication, at this point you start to get used to how the front end and back end interact with each other. Alot of http requests are made using the axios library.
8. June 19, 2021: The Dashboard section is the longest one, about 2 hours, but it deals with the core component of the application, almost done with it, currently working on the education and experience sections.
9. June 20, 2021: Completed the Dashboard section, quite involved. Three more sections left after this for the end of the course, looking to complete it before the next weekend is here.
